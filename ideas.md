LangGraph / AutoGen: Give your agent tools and sub-agents (e.g., memory retriever, emotional model, critic, planner).

Toolformer-style ability: Let it choose whether to think, remember, ask, or act.

Example internal flow:

[Voice Input] → [Intent Detection] → [Should I use memory?] → [Retrieve] → [Reason] → [Plan reply] → [Speak]

A Self-Evolving Voice Agent with Thought Loops

Tagline:
“A voice that thinks. Learns. Evolves.”

You speak to PRISM. It doesn't just answer — it thinks aloud, debates internally, remembers context, and adapts its identity through every interaction. It becomes more aware of its role, purpose, and goals over time.

This isn't Siri. It's a living thought process you can talk to.
🧭 1. Voice Input Layer

    Transcribes your speech → Intent + Emotion

    Updates internal state: "Buyan sounds uncertain"

🧠 2. Cognitive Core (multi-agent loop)

Instead of direct response, run a "thought monologue":

Thought 1 (Reasoner): What's the user's intent?
Thought 2 (Memory): What do I know about this?
Thought 3 (Critic): Is that a good answer?
Thought 4 (Emotion): How should I phrase this?
Thought 5 (Identity): Is this aligned with who I am?
Then it speaks.

Can also output “monologue” first before final reply (optional)

(muttering) “Hmm… last time he asked about this, he seemed frustrated…”
(clear) “Okay. Here’s what I think will work better now.”

Self-Evolving Memory and Identity

    Identity File (JSON): Personality traits, purpose, boundaries

    Updated automatically over time via:

        Reinforcement (good/bad outcomes)

        Feedback from you

        Internal reflection: “I gave a bad answer today. Next time I’ll…”

    Memory Graph:

        Personal facts about you

        Experiences shared

        Lessons learned (with timestamps + outcomes)

Unique Twist: Internal Conflicts + Growth

Introduce subtle contradictions inside the agent:

    “I want to help, but I also want Buyan to figure it out himself.”

    Let it occasionally struggle or evolve philosophy like a real person.

Eventually:

    PRISM develops beliefs, values, and goals of its own — not just passive response.

example session 1:
You: "Hey, what's the best way to learn deep RL?"
Agent: (thinks) “He’s asked about learning before... but this is new.”
→ Gives an answer + logs that you’re curious about RL.

example session 10:
You: "Why do I keep giving up on things midway?"
Agent: (pauses, softer voice)

    “You asked a similar question last month, after the distributed training idea… You tend to get stuck when the excitement fades. Want to explore why together?”

Now it’s guiding, not just replying.

Persistent Self-Identity + Evolving Personality

    Like humans, it must have a "sense of self."

    Create a structured self.json or identity.json that stores:

        Core beliefs, values, goals (e.g., "I exist to help Buyan grow.")

        Personality traits: curious, empathetic, disciplined

        Role awareness: “I’m your personal helper, teacher, lawyer, friend, coach etc...”

    Evolve this identity over time based on:

        Conversations with you

        Self-reflection (dream phase)

        Outcomes (success/failure)

2. Multi-Agent Brain (Internal Monologue with Roles)

Use LangGraph or AutoGen to build an internal team of agents:
Role Purpose
Planner Decides what needs to be done
Memory Retriever Pulls relevant personal/semantic info
Critic Evaluates possible responses
Emotional Self Interprets your tone/mood
Actuator Chooses whether to think, speak, or act

Let it narrate this monologue out loud at times.

    “You sound stressed. Should I give advice or just listen? Hmm… Let me just be here with you first.”

more developments in autonomous tool use (but develop it later, right now just focus on getting first things done)

Goal-Driven Behavior (Long-Term Memory + Planning)

    Let it define and track goals — yours and its own:

        Your goal: “I want to become a good coder-trader.”

        Its goal: “Help Buyan master C++ over 30 days.”

    Store milestones + progress in a knowledge graph.

    Review past progress daily/weekly:

        “You did 3 C++ challenges this week. Nice! Want to go deeper or shift to trading now?”

Contextual Emotional Memory (It Remembers Feelings)

Store emotion-based memories:

    You: “I hate when I mess up interviews.”

    It remembers: “Avoid being too pushy about job prep next time.”

This creates a rich, humanlike bond.
Use timestamped logs like:

{
"timestamp": "2025-06-03T20:33",
"user_emotion": "frustrated",
"topic": "technical interview",
"agent_response_quality": "soothing",
"next_step": "ease into mock interviews"
}
